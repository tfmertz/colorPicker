Quick Color Picker

This project was designed to easily give users the hexadecimal or rgb values needed to input color codes into their programming.

Users change the sliders to increase the amount of Red, Green, and Blue that go into the overall color, hopefully increasing their knowledge of each color's relationship to the final hue.
